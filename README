About
=====
This is a minimal and glitchy game for MPS430G2231 microcontroller and
the Launch Pad development board. It was an excercise project for 
Tapani Tarvainen's C and embedded developemnt course at University of 
Jyväskylä. I hope that it can serve as a some kind of demonstration for
platform possibilities. Anyone reading the code shouldn't judge it as an
example of good code but rather as an example of really small a game.

Background
==========
The aim of this project is to create "Simon Says" game for the MSP430 micro-
controller and the LaunchPad developer board surrounding it, so that the
device flashes LEDs in certain pattern, and after that, user is required
to repeat the pattern to win the game. Development is currently done with
TI Code Composer Studio IDE, which is Eclipse-based development environment.

This project will be released with GNU GPLv3 terms once it is fulfills
the course assignment requirements.
